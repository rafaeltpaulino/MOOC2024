#Exercícios do módulo "Getting Started da primeira parte do curso"

#1 Please write a program which prints out an emoticon: :-)
# Write your solution here
print(":-)")

#2 "Seitsemän veljestä" is one of the first novels ever written in Finnish. It is the story of seven orphaned brothers learning to make their way in the world (read more on Wikipedia).
#This program is supposed to print out the names of the brothers in alphabetical order, but it's not working quite right yet. Please fix the program so that the names are printed in the correct order.
#print("Simeoni")
#print("Juhani")
#print("Eero")
#print("Lauri")
#print("Aapo")
#print("Tuomas")
#print("Timo")
# Fix the code
print("Aapo")
print("Eero")
print("Juhani")
print("Lauri")
print("Simeoni")
print("Timo")
print("Tuomas")

#3 Please write a program which prints out the following lines exactly as they are written here, punctuation and all:
#Sample output

#Row, row, row your boat,
#Gently down the stream.
#Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
#Life is but a dream.
# Write your solution here
print("Row, row, row your boat,")
print("Gently down the stream.")
print("Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,")
print("Life is but a dream.")

#4 Please write a program which prints out the number of minutes in a year. Use Python code to perform the calculation, as in the previous code example.
# Write your solution here
print("Minutes in a year: ")
print((24*60)*365)

#5 Thus far, you have probably used double quotation marks " to print out strings. In addition to the double quotation marks, Python also accepts single quotation marks '.
#This comes in handy if you ever want to print out the actual quotation marks themselves:
#print('"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.')
#Sample output
#"Come right back!", shouted the police officer.
#Please write a program which prints out the following:
#Sample output
#print("Hello there!")
# Write your solution here
print('print("Hello there!")')
